<desc>Late game ships have bigger crews. Another step to make late game a little more challenging.

Situations when a Rebel Rigger or a Mantis Fighter simply does not have enough weapon power to penetrate player shields are too frequent. Needs to be fixed.</desc>
<changelog>Crew size for late game enemy ships increased:
Rock Assault: 3-6 -> 5-7
Rock Aggressor: 2-6 -> 5-7
Rock Elite: 4-5 -> 6-8
Mantis Bomber: 4-6 -> 5-8
Mantis Aggressor: 3-6 -> 5-8

Rebel Riggers (including pirates) now have stronger weapons (Minimum weapon power 1 -> 2)
Mantis Fighters (including pirates) now have stronger weapons (Minimum weapon power 1 -> 2)</changelog>
