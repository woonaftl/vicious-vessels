A mod for FTL: Faster Than Light

Submission guidelines

1. All content your submit (including text, images, and audio) must be made by yourself entirely.

2. The aim of the project is to make a lot of tiny incremental changes to FTL, expand the game without making it too different in feel from vanilla. The best way to do it is to add new events and new enemy ships.

3. Another goal is to structure everything without too many dependencies. Everything should be packed neatly in its own tiny module. You should be able to remove any modules without breaking anything. This is needed for customization and finding bugs.

4. New drones and weapons change the game balance a bit too much and have too many limitations. If you really want to submit a new drone or weapon, make it very rare and only available to player or unique enemy ships.

5. Use some sort of prefix for compatibility with other mods.

Finally, any submission is welcome. Feedback is appreciated. You can use any assets from this mod in your own projects.

Thanks for participating.
