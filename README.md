A mod for FTL: Faster Than Light

Submission guidelines

1. All content your submit (including text, images, and audio) must be made by yourself entirely.

2. The aim of the project is to make a lot of tiny incremental changes to FTL, expand the game without making it too different in feel from vanilla. The best way to do it is to add new events and new enemy ships.

3. Another goal is to structure everything without too many dependencies. Everything should be packed neatly in its own tiny module. You should be able to remove any modules without breaking anything. This is needed for customization and finding bugs.

4. New drones and weapons change the game balance a bit too much and have too many limitations. If you really want to submit a new drone or weapon, make it very rare and only available to player or unique enemy ships.

5. Use some sort of prefix for compatibility with other mods.


If you really want to help the mod grow, but don't know how

1. The easiest way is to just play the mod, and post feedback regarding balance, ship sprites, bugs, etc.

2. A step above describing issues you find is fixing them by yourself and committing changes.

3. The easiest way to add new content is to write an event. Events have structure defined by xml tags and texts contained in a separate file. As long as event actually works, and fits the game's theme, it is fine. Humorous events are especially welcome.

4. If you are more into drawing compared to writing, a good way to expand the mod is to add a new ship. Hand-drawn enemy ships, similar to original game's style, are the best possible addition. To actually add the ship to the game, you can use Superluminal by KartoFlane.

5. While the mod does not have any custom audio right now, it would be nice to have. Music reminiscent of original game's soundtrack would be a very welcome addition.

6. Another good way of helping is making tools or writing guides to help other modders. A detailed guide on making events? A script that automatically makes cloak images? Just throwing some ideas there.


Finally, any submission is welcome. Feedback is appreciated. You can use any assets from this mod in your own projects.

Thank you. <3
