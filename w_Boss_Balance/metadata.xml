<desc>Minor buffs to Flagship to make the fight a little bit more challenging.

Most of enemy ships in FTL have all of their rooms connected (with some exceptions like Auto ships). When rooms are disconnected it causes weird behaviour and strategies (like leaving one dude alive in a disconnected room to prevent the boss from entering AI mode).

When the crew is dead, it's only logical that the oxygen is disabled. The Flagship becomes an Auto ship at this point.</desc>
<changelog>The Rebel Flagship Laser Artillery weapon shoots Heavy Lasers and deals 2 damage instead of 1.
The Rebel Flagship has all rooms connected on all difficulty levels.
The Rebel Flagship disables oxygen and medbay when its crew is dead.</changelog>
