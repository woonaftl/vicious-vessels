<desc>Slug Interceptor (the tiny one) had isolated rooms before and became a meme for having the worst possible ship layout, allowing easy crew kills.

Now it uses the pirate layout. Creating a completely new layout for non-pirate ship messes up with the brains of veteran players.

Also, more than 2 weapons do not fit on the hull. Dunno if the limitation I put here works.</desc>
<changelog>Slug Interceptor no longer has disconnected rooms.</changelog>
