<desc>Drones are unreliable and rarely used. The goal of these changes is to make drones slightly cheaper in terms of scrap and power and make good drones easier available.

Also, drones are just sold very frequently because the player simply does not have a slot for Drone Control. So, having expensive drones in the game sucks as they are just scrap for next store.

Hull Repair drone becomes ultra rare because it's OP. But it's cheaper, because if you are buying a drone, you already go for an unorthodox strategy: using drones! It shouldn't be punished.

Anti Drone becomes rare because it's useless, and making it viable is almost impossible.

All changes are economical not to mess with players' brains. Prices end with zeros to make new prices a bit easier to memorize.</desc>
