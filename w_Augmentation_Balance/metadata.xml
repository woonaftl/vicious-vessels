<desc>The most common strategy for augmentations in FTL is just selling them (unless it's Long Ranged Scanners). The changes to augmentation costs are aimed to decrease the amount of scrap the player gets from selling augmentations they got for free (including those at the start of the game). Maybe, buying them in stores will be slightly more viable, too (especially for useful augmentations like Zoltan Bypass, Defense Scrambler or Drone Recovery Arm).

Some augmentations like Drone Booster, Fire Suppression, Crystal Vengeance etc are so pathetic that they need a direct buff so using them becomes a somewhat valid decision.

Made Drone Recovery Arm and Exposive Replicator more common to make drones and missiles a little bit more viable. FTL related augmentations are made more common, because they enable more strategies related to diving.

Long Ranged Scanners are clearly imbalanced, but they are kinda fun, and A LOT of people like them and rely on them, so no changes to them.

Most prices for augmentations are set to 30 or 40 to make new prices easier to remember.</desc>
