<text name="W_ENERGY_ION_TEXT_0">A Zoltan ship awaits you at the beacon, dangerously close to a pulsar. To your surprise, the ship begins an attacking maneuver. The weapons spring from its hull, and a swarm of boarding drones is flying out of the airlocks towards your ship.</text>
<text name="W_ENERGY_ION_TEXT_1">The Zoltan ship hails you. "Forgive us for using weapons against you. It was nothing but a test of your military strength. Please take this and leave us alone."</text>
<text name="W_ENERGY_ION_TEXT_2">With all of the Zoltans dead, you move on to strip their ship of useful materials.</text>
<text name="W_ENERGY_ION_TEXT_3">Accept their offer.</text>
<text name="W_ENERGY_ION_TEXT_4">We will not accept surrender!</text>
